Back End Liverpool 

For the back-end development, we have chosen to use Flask, a widely used Python framework for building server-side web applications.
To install Flask, simply navigate to the folder named "BackLiverpool" and execute the following command in the terminal:

```bash
pip install flask
```

To run it, simply access your terminal and type the following command:
```bash
python .\server.py
```
